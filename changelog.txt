Changelog for SEOLite
=====================

Release Candidate :-P
---------------------
* French language file added
* Renamed language key "welcome" to "seo_lite_welcome" as this sometimes confliced with other modules who used the same language key

1.2.4 - 23rd feb 2011
---------------------

This update includes database changes and requires that you visit the module in the backend (EE will then automatically run the update script).)

* htmlspecialchars() all metadata before output (there were problems with the use of quotes etc. in default description)
* Increased size of the default keywords / descripton to 1024 chars
* Changed coltype of default_title_postfix to VARCHAR(60) instead of CHAR(60) (char would strip trailing space, thus the need for &nbsp; .. that's no longer needed)


1.2.3 - 21st feb 2011
---------------------

* Added support for {canonical_url} for use in the SEOLite template like this:	<link rel=“canonical” href='{canonical_url}' />
* Added 'ignore_last_segments' parameter which tells SEO Lite to ignore the X last url segments (ie. 2 would be logical for URL: entries/some_entry_here/sort/asc)
* Improved support for pages - the "Pages URI" will now override "URL Title"
* Minor change in how the "title_postfix" parameter works - the default postfix (specified in admin) will now always be added after this
